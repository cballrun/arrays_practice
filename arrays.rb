# Arrays Practice

## String Variables

friends = ["Paul", "Chuck", "Jack", "J", "Chase"]

## Integer Variables

steak_weight = [4, 8, 12, 20]

## Float Variables

steak_weight_pounds = [0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.25]

## Boolean Variables

large_weight = [5 = true, 20 = true, 1 = false, 2 = false]


## Pop Method

#The below method and command will return the value "Chase" and then remove it from the array. The command after that will show the array with "Chase" removed

 friends.pop
 puts friends

 ## Push Method

#The below method will return the steak_weight array and add the integer 24 to it

steak_weight.push 24

## Shift method

#The below method will remove the boolean 5 = true from the array large_weight and return the value 5 = true

large_weight.shift


## Unshift method

The below method will add 2 to the beginning of the steak_weight_pounds Arrays

steak_weight_pounds.unshift 24
